# Connecting a motor to Arduino
Arduino microcontrollers are the heart of countless DIY projects, from robots to automated systems. To bring these projects to life, you often need to interface them with motors. In this guide, we'll walk you through the essential steps of connecting a motor to an Arduino using a separate power supply while ensuring control with precision using an NPN transistor. This approach allows you to harness the full potential of your motorized creations without overloading your Arduino.
